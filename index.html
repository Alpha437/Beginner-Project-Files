      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
      <img src="../images/html5-logo.png" alt="html-logo" />

      <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML provides a
        means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
        for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other
        items. If you're interested in building a website, web development, or
        just coding in general, learning HTML is a great place to start.

      <h3>Is HTML a programming language?</h3>

      <p>
        Whether HTML is or is not technically a “programming” language is an
        ongoing debate among web developers and experts. While the majority
        defines HTML as a “markup” language (not a programming language) some
        argue the two aren't mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        All programming languages have some functional purpose — they need to
        “do” something, whether it be evaluating expressions, declaring
        variables, or modifying data. JavaScript is the most widely-used
        programming language in web development. Other popular programming
        languages include Python, Java, and C.

      <h3>What is HTML used for?</h3>

      <p>
        HTML is primarily used for creating web pages. HTML is free to use and
        ensures your text, images, and other elements are displayed as intended.
      </p>

      <p>
        With HTML, not only can you add headings, paragraphs, lists, and other
        elements to your page — you can also embed images, videos, audio files,
        and other multimedia. And, you can link to other web pages on the same
        website or from another site. This allows visitors to easily navigate
        your website and jump between websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML is used to create things other than web pages, too. You can use it
        to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>make tables for organizing data</li>
        <li>
          create forms for collecting user information, processing transactions,
          making reservations, or placing an order
        </li>
        <li>create emails with HTML</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

      <h3>How to Write HTML</h3>

      <p>
        The main building block of an HTML web page is an element. An HTML
        element is a unit of information that tells the web browser what to
        render for the viewer. An HTML element could be a piece of text like a
        paragraph, an interactive item like a button, or a section of the page
        like a header or footer.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img
          src="../images/HTML Element diagram.png"
          alt="html-element"
          width="350"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Here's what a basic element looks like written out in HTML. This
          element is called the < button > element, and creates a button on the
          screen that users can click with the mouse.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
      <p>
        HTML elements are designated by tags. Most elements have an opening tag
        and a closing tag. Opening tags precede contain the element name
        enclosed by angle brackets (<>). Closing tags are identical to opening
        tags, save for a slash (/) that precedes the element name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tags contain an element's content. Content may be text, a media item, or
        even other elements.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, say you want to add a paragraph to your web page, the the paragraph
        contains the text “This is a paragraph.” You'll wrap it with the HTML
        paragraph tags < p> and < /p>.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
      <p>
        While all HTML elements need tags, only some require attributes. An HTML
        attribute is text inside of the opening tag that provides additional
        information about the HTML element.
      </p>

      <p>
        An attribute is always found in the opening tag of an HTML element. Most
        have the syntax name=“value”, though some attributes only require you to
        write the name without any assigned value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some elements require certain attributes. For example, an HTML image
        element (< img>) must always contain a source attribute (src) whose
        value is the image URL or file path. Otherwise, the browser will not
        know what image to render.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, the anchor element (< a>), which creates a hyperlink, must
        contain an href attribute with a value that specifies the link's
        destination. Otherwise, if a visitor clicks on the anchor element, the
        browser won't send them anywhere.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML Page Structure</h3>
      <p>Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:</p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="../images/html-page-structure.png"
          alt="html-page-structure"
          width="600"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Note: The content inside the < body> section will be displayed in a
          browser. The content inside the < title> element will be shown in the
          browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
